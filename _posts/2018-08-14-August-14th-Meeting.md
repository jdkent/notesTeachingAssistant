## Reading Notes

### [The Power of Email][1]

#### Notes

- sending individualized emails to struggling students is an example of a classroom nudge: an intervention that encourages, but does not mandate a certain behavior.
- important to make the email non-judgmental

#### Reflection
I haven't thought of help being applied in this proactive manner.
The majority of what I've thought about is making resources explicit and easy to access, but still leaving it to the student to take the first step to express interest in accessing resources.

### [Extraordinary Teaching Project][2]

#### Notes

- **Individualized Learning in a large class**
    - each student get unique problems (same wording, different numbers), so students have to ask each other for the process as opposed to the answer.
- **Developing Critical Thinking Through Peer Review**
    -
