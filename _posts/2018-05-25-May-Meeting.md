### [How Learning Works][1]

#### Seven Principles
1. [**Students' prior knowledge can help or hinder learning**](#principle-one)
2. [**How students organize knowledge influences how they learn and apply what they know**](#principle-two)
3. [**Students' motivation determines, directs, and sustains what they do to learn**](#principle-three)
4. [**To develop mastery, students must acquire component skills, practice integrating them, and know when to apply what they have learned**](#principle-four)
5. [**Goal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback enhances the quality of students' learning**](#principle-five)
6. [**Students' current level of development interacts with the social, emotional, and intellectual climate of the course to impact learning**](#principle-six)
7. [**To become self-directed learners, students must learn to monitor and adjust their approaches to learning**](#principle-seven)

#### <a name="principle-one">Students' prior knowledge can help or hinder learning
- helps when prior knowledge is:
    - activated,
    - sufficient,
    - appropriate, AND
    - accurate
- hinders when prior knowledge is:
    - inactive,
    - insufficient,
    - inappropriate, OR
    - inaccurate
- **takeaways**
    - **explicitly activate prior knowledge** (example, when working through a couple problems, walkthrough the first one, and then tell the students to work through the second one while thinking about how they solved the first)
    - **ask questions to specifically trigger prior knowledge** (elaborative interrogation)
    - **connect concepts to the students lives** (e.g. teaching variance, ask the students about high and low variance scenarios in their own lives)
    - **Draw the edges of analogies.** Let the student's know where analogies break down.
    - **Talk to colleagues**s about what prior knowledge students may be bringing to the course
    - **Administer a low stakes test/quiz** to assess prior knowledge
    - **Self-assessment by students** by giving them a likert scales on how familiar they are with requisite concepts.
    - **Use brainstorming to reveal Prior Knowledge.**
    - **Ask the students to make a concept map about a subject**
    - **Look for patterns of errors in student work**
    - **Explicitly link new material to knowledge from previous courses and your own course**
    - **Use analogies & examples** that connect to Students' everyday knowledge
    - **Ask students to reason** on the basis of relevant prior knowledge
    - **Highlight conditions of applicability** (example, statistics instructor saying a regression analysis can be used for quantitative variables but not for qualitative variables)
    - **Ask students to make and test predictions**
    - **Ask students to justify their reasoning**

#### <a name="principle-two">How students organize knowledge influences how they learn and apply what they know
- general notes
    - novices have sparse connections between knowledge nodes, or knowledge is chained
    - experts have hierarchically organized node, or a rich graph.
- **takeaways**
    - **give an advance organizer**: a set of principles or propositions that provide a cognitive structure to guide the incorporation of new information
    - **create a concept map** to analyze your own knowledge organization
    - **analyze tasks** to identify the most appropriate knowledge organization
    - **provide students with the organizational structure of the course.** give them a view of the "big picture" via a flow chart or verbally, and go back to this organization throughout the course.
    - **explicitly share the organization of each lecture**, lab, or discussion: give an outline with key takeaways you want the students to take from the lectures.
    - **Use contrasting and Boundary Cases** to highlight organizing features
    - **Explicitly highlight deep features**: give examples of problems that share deep features but differ superficially
    - **Make connections among concepts explicit**. draw how the new concepts connects with previous concepts.
    - **Encourage students to work with multiple organizing structures**: for example, ask students to classify plants en their evolutionary histories and then on the basis of native habitat.
    - **ask students to draw their own concept maps.**
    - **use a sorting task to expose students' knowledge organizations**. give the students a group of concepts/problems with some superficial and deep similarities and have the students organize them without explicit criteria.
    - Monitor Student's work for problems in their knowledge organization.

#### <a name="principle-three">Students' motivation determines, directs, and sustains what they do to learn

#### <a name="principle-four">To develop mastery, students must acquire component skills, practice integrating them, and know when to apply what they have learned

#### <a name="principle-five">Goal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback enhances the quality of students' learning

#### <a name="principle-six">Students' current level of development interacts with the social, emotional, and intellectual climate of the course to impact learning

#### <a name="principle-seven">To become self-directed learners, students must learn to monitor and adjust their approaches to learning
