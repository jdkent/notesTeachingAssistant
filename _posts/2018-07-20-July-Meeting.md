## Reading Notes

### [CAST Universal Design for Learning][1]

#### Notes

- **Engagement**: The "WHY" of learning
  - Recruiting Interest
    - Optimize individual choice and autonomy
      - Give the students agency in designing the classroom activity or the parameters of the task.
    - Optimize relevance, value, and authenticity
      - connect the lessons to the student's daily life or their learning goals.
    - Minimize threats and distractions
      - create an accepting and supportive classroom climate.
      - create calendars/cues that can increase the predictability of events.
      - involve _all_ students in discussions
  - Sustaining effort & Persistence
    - Heighten salience of goals and obectives
      - restate the goals or have the student restate the goals multiple times in multiple ways
    - Vary demands and resources to optimize challenge
      - emphasize process and improvement as opposed to external evaluation and competition
      - provide alternatives in the tools the student can use
      - provide a range of demands and a range possible resources.
    - Foster collaboration and community
      - create cooperative learning groups with clear goals, roles, and responsibilities.
      - provide prompts that guide learners in when and how to ask peers and/or teachers for help
      - create expectations for group work
    - Increase mastery-oriented feedback
      - give timely, frequent feedback that focuses on effort and improvement as opposed to relative performance.
  - Self Regulation
    - Promote expectations and beliefs that optimize motivation
      - set personal goals that can be realistically reached.
      - support activities that encourage self-reflection and identification of personal goals.
    - Facilitate personal coping skills and strategies
      - provide differentiated models, scaffolds, and feedback for managing frustration, developing internal controls and coping skills, seeking external emotional support
    - Develop self-assessment and reflection
      - have students collect data about their own behavior to monitor changes, and stay motivated.
- **Representation**: The "WHAT" of learning
  - Perception
    - Offer ways of customizing the display of information
      - size of text, images
      - color used for emphasis
      - volume or rate of speech or sound
      - speed/timing of videos
    - Offer alternatives for auditory information
      - text equivalents (captions/transcripts, tactile interactions)
    - Offer alternatives for visual information
      - provide descriptions (text or spoken) for all images, graphics, video, and animations
      - use touch equivalents
  - Language & Symbols
    - Clarify vocabulary and symbols
      - pre-teach vocabulary and symbols that emphasize connections to the learners' experience and prior knowledge
      - break down complex terms into smaller parts
      - embed support for vocabulary in the text (via hyperlinks)
    - Clarify syntax and structure
      - highlight structural relations
      - make connections to previously learned structures
      - make relationships between elements explicit
    - Support decoding of text, mathematical notation, and symbols.
      - automatic text-to-speech translations of symbols to speech
    - Promote understanding across languages
    - Illustrate through multiple media
  - Comprehension
    - Activate or supply background knowledge
    - Highlight patterns, critical features, big ideas, and relationships
    - Guide information processing and visualization
    - Maximize transfer and generalization
- **Action & Expression**: The "HOW" of learning
  - Physical Action
    - Vary the methods for response and navigation
      - eg respond with pencil/paper, a mouse, a joystick, etc.
    - Optimize access to tools and assistive technologies
  - Expression & Communication
    - Use multiple media for expression
    - Use multiple tools for composition and construction
    - Build fluencies with graduated levels of support for practice and performance
  - Executive Functions
    - Guide appropriate goal-setting
      - provide prompts to estimate effort, resources, and difficulty
    - Support planning and strategy development
    - Facilitate managing information and resources
    - Enhance capacity for monitoring progress.

#### Reflection

Some repeated themes I've gathered from this reading and previous readings are:

- give the students some control of their learning for them to be optimally invested in the outcomes
- present the material in multiple different ways and repeatedly
- allow time for self-reflection and assessment

This reading doesn't necessarily give a lot of novel take aways, but does provide a great overarching conceptual framework (thus the name UDL)

### [Michigan Center's Strategies for Inclusive Teaching][2]

#### Notes

**NA**

#### Reflection
I particularly liked this recommendation:
> "Include authorsâ€™ full names, not just initials, in citations. (This can help emphasize gender diversity or unsettle assumptions about authorship).
"
This checklist encourages getting to know each other, both instructor-student interactions and student-student interactions

### [OTFD Framework][3]

#### Notes

- Open The Front Door Communication Framework
  - Observe: Concrete factual observation, not evaluative (I noticed)
  - Think: Thoughts based on observation (I think)
  - Feel: Emotions (I feel)
  - Desire: Specific request or inquiry about desired outcome (I would like)

#### Reflection

Something I haven't dealt with as a mentor/teacher yet, and this reading provides great openers to cover contriversal statements/topics students may have brought up.
