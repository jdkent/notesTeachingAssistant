## Reading Notes
### [The Minutes Before Class][1]
- How are you?
    - ask the students about their day
- Display the framework
    - put up an outline of the lecture or a list of the topics to be covered in class today
- Create wonder
    - post an image and ask two questions:
        - what do you notice?
        - what do you wonder?

### [The First Five Minutes of Class][2]
- Open with a question or two
    - revisit the questions at the end to see what they learned
- What did we learn last time?
    - "retrieval practice": ask the students what the main points of the last lecture was
- reactivate what they learned in previous courses
    - asking students what they know from previous coursework
- write it down
    - for the answers of any of the previous posed questions, have the students write them down

### [Space It Out][3]
- make all assessments at least (partially cumulative)
    - during assignments, present material from the previous section 
- the spaced syllabus
    - ask the students to write about how today's material relates to material covered in a previous  class
- space out deadlines and tests
    - give many smaller tests to examine learning and comprehension

### [The Last Five Minutes of Class][4]
- the minute paper
    - ask two questions: what was the most important thing you learned today and what question still remains in your mind?
- closing connections
    - ask the students to draw connections between their learning and the world around them
- the metacognitive five
    - ask the students how they studied or will study for an exam (fix behaviors of just reading notes)
- close the loop
    - if you asked any questions at the beginning, end by revisiting those questions

## Meeting Notes
- sometimes the TA's are treated as god-like, if we don't interact with the student's before hand.
- How open should the TA be? Finding an ally versus getting TMI < err potentially on the side of too open
- takeaway: giving resources on the syllabus (for mental health, learning disabilities, etc)
- considering the landscape of the classroom: front versus back.
- balance between wonder and set up exploratory questions for the class
- role question: a question that gets at your personality (what is your favorite tom hanks movie?)
- wonder not only in fascination, but also can create dissonance to correct
- Asking open questions with intention of a specific answer could dissuade students from answering (ask better questions)
- check in on the class after a certain amount of time, to see who has an idea, and who has no idea.
- teaching students that there are different questions types.
- Students respond best to questions "I" don't have a direct answer to, (no single right answer)
