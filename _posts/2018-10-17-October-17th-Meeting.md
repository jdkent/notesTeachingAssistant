## Notes from reading

choosing content:

- think about what perspectives are being represented.
- find readings/materials from people with a diverse background

Increase awareness of problematic assumptions:

- poor assumptions
- students will seek help when they are struggling with a class
- ans: set mandatory 1-1 meetings
- students from certain groups are not intellectual, are irresponsible, are satisfied with below average grades, lack ability, have high ability in particular subject areas, etc.
- ans: have high expectations for all students, set meetings if students fall below a certain threshold. Important to make initial contact, but let students carry the conversation forward
- students from certain backgrounds are poor writers.
- ans: don't assume, give an ungraded written assignment using the writing structure necessary in the class to identify students that may need additional help.
- poor writing suggests limited intellectual ability
- ans: be explicit about what is expected and share examples of good writing done by other students (give resources to improve writing)
- older students/students with physical disabilities are slower learners and require more attention from the instructor.
- ans: just isn't true
- students whose cultural affiliation is tied to non-english speaking groups are not native english speakers or are bilingual
- ans: ascertain language ability in one-one meetings, don't do it in class
- people of certain backgrounds are spokespeople for that background and europeans do not have opinions on race
- ans: pose questions to class, and not to certain groups

- students from group are a monolith and necessarily different from the majority
- encourage all different view types/perspectives regardless of person.
- in readings, students will only relate to characters that resemble them
- ans:white person can relate to a black character, probe the relationship.
- students from certain groups are likely to have more conflict and be more extreme
- ans: start discussions with writing exercise to better develop viewpoints/perspectives.

planning considerations:

- read the calendar for any religious holidays recognized by the university
- contact disabilities service for information about accomadations
- ask students at beginning to let you know about any holidays absences they may have during the semester
- alway record attendance (since some students are more visible than others and it may bias your attention on who has been more absent)

- assess ability at the beginning of the class to see what prior experiences students have had

- be aware of my preferred instructional strategies

- at the beginning of the semester do more group activities so the students and you interact more to get to know each other.

- don't let students self form groups (unless explicit criteria for making the group diverse is included)

- when in groups, make sure students switch roles throughout the semester so they have experience with both roles

Getting to know the students:

- have the students write a brief autobiography in the beginning of the semester ( ask for students experiences in math in science or relationship with math/science over their life.)
- also ask how they learn best
- examine course content for weaknesses

- acknowledge what you don't know
- make decisions about when to devote unanticipated time to class discussions to deal with issues raised by students.

- do not sound dismissal of any student comments
