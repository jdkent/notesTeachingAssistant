## Reading Notes

### [Teaching What You Don't Know][1]
#### Notes
- **fundamental problem with experts teaching**: we take for granted fundamental knowledge or basic steps that the learner has not mastered.
- **content novices have three advantages**
    1. Novices have a more realistic assessment of the time it will take a learner to complete a task.
    2. Novices have a better idea on the number of steps another person will need to complete a task.
    3. Novices are more likely to relate difficult concepts to everyday, common knowledge
#### Reflection
- toward point 3, however, would a content novice be able to make a metaphor/analogy and know when it breaks down?
- This article appears to motivate paired teaching for instructors that are experts in different aspects of the material (so they can test lectures and explanations on each other to make sure the course material works)

### [Interdisciplinary Approaches to Teaching][2]
#### Notes
- Interdisciplinary Teaching: entails the use and integration of methods and analytical frameworks from more than one academic discipline to examine a theme, issue, question, or topic.
- Why use Interdisciplinary approaches?
    - problems we face in the real world don't fit nicely into a single discipline.
- How to teach in an Interdisciplinary Manner?
    - obstacle: moving beyond examination of an issue from the lens of multiple disciplines, to the synthesis and integration of insights into a more inclusive framework of analysis
- Six steps to interdisciplinary Teaching
    1. **Pre-Instructional Planning**: encourages instructor to get the requisite knowledge and develop an action plan
    2. **Introduce the Methodology to Students**: emphasize the importance of integrating insights and approaches from multiple disciplines to form a framework of analysis that will lead to a rich understanding of complex questions. Be explicit to the students about learning goals.
    3. **Take it to the Classroom**: Demonstrate how to explore questions from an interdisciplinary perspective in the classroom
    4. **Practice Interdisciplinary Thinking**: talk about an issue from the perspective of one discipline and make it homework (or a class exercise) for the students to incorporate an additional discipline in the analysis of the issue.
    5. **Provide Feedback**: Give many opportunities for feedback by evaluating the assignments in the previous bullet point.
    6. **Assessment**: have the students engage in self evaluation periodically by rating their ability to:
        - set out the structure of multiple disciplines that are well suited to the problem of interest
        - synthesize insights from multiple disciplines
        - integrate idead across disciplines
#### Reflection
- Interdisciplinary work may be baked into neuroscience. Coming up with the psychological terms and associated them with neurobiological interpretations/mechanisms is interdisciplinary

### [10 Interdisciplinary Teaching Activity Examples][3]
#### Notes
- benefits of interdisciplinary teaching
    1. Improved Critical Thinking
    2. Better Bias Recognition
    3. Preperation for Future Problems
- **ten activities**
    1. News Analysis (**real-world interdisciplinary problems**): show a news clip and give the students a related question. Have them incorporate multiple sources to generate a solution.
    2. Historical Pen Pals (**developing creative writing skills in the process**): each student takes the role of a historical figure and write to a classmate about events they faced (these events can come from multiple aspects of the figures life, collecting interdisciplinary information)
    3. Math Gym (**Combine math and science with physical education**): dive into the physics of how to complete a long jump, before doing the activity.
    4. World Traveller (**build research skills while touching on core subjects**): have students plan vacations, they have to integrate culture, history, language, and perhaps use technology to integrate this information.
    5. Leaning Tower (**delving into more subjects**): have students make a project surrounding a specific topic, such as Italy's famous tower. The project can be about the physics of when it may fall, the history/culture, setting a budget, etc.
    6. Incentives (**touch on business, philosophy, and social studies**): split students into small groups, give them tokens totalling $1,000, and stations to spend the tokens on. Each station could be economic, social, or moral. Have the students reflect on their choices.
    7. Field Study (**Introduce new learning environments**): observe the bugs, write about them or watch nature videos afterwords and reflect.
    8. All About Weather (**Connect science with social studies**): observe how weather changes impact society (labour, agriculture, culture)
    9. More than a "Just" Book (**Make language arts class more memorable**): immerse the student in the setting of the book by recreating scientific discoveries that were found at that time.
    10. Study-Free Test Preparation (**giving them methods to use throughout their academic careers**): as well as studying what are the best ways to prepare onself for an upcoming test.
- How to design Interdisciplinary units in 5 steps
    1. **Assess your students and setting**
    2. **Create an Organizing Center**
        - can take the form of:
            - topics
            - issues
            - themes
            - works
            - problems
    3. **Develop Essential Questions**
        - somewhat complicated (encourage to break down the problem)
        - rooted in concepts that are clearly applicable across subjects
        - completable within the allotted time frame
        - relevant and interesting to students
    4. **Plan and Run Activities**
        - give students chances to reflect on content and their work
    5. **Review Student Performance and the Unit itself**
        - Student performance
            - products
            - teamwork
            - participation
            - critical thinking
        - Unit performance
            - student engagement
            - connections with different subjects
            - effectiveness of organizing center
            - relevancy and applicability of essential questions
#### Reflection
- A lot of emphasis on student driven activities (and giving them time to work on projects) and giving time for reflection.

### [Co-Teaching: How to Make it Work][4]
#### Notes
- "push-in" arrangement, a general education teacher partners with a specialist who may be certified in teaching a special population.
- Co-teaching structures
    - **One teach, one observe**: observer collects data on student understanding for better planning of future instruction
    - **One teach, one assist**: assister moves around the classroom helping struggling students.
    - **Parallel teaching**: class divided into two groups and same material is presented simultaneously by both teachers
    - **Station teaching**: students rotate through stations with a teacher at each one.
    - **Alternative teaching**: one teacher takes a small group of students and provides them more intensive or specialized instruction, different from what the larger group recieves.
    - **Team Teaching**: both teachers teach the content at the same time in tandem or "tag team" fashion
- How to make the partnership work
    1. respect each other
    2. Clearly Define Roles and Responsibilities
    3. Be Flexible
    4. Plan Together (15-60 minutes a day)
    5. Don't take yourself too seriously
    6. Communicate, Communicate, Communicate (like via slack)
    7. Seek Administrative Support
#### Reflection
- Partner teachers seem like a good test audience for lessons (perhaps they are more novice and can provide that perspective)
- I wonder if the splitting the class up into disciplines, have each teacher explain the issue and problem solve from that discipline perspective and then have the students come together to integrate with what the other student has learned.
