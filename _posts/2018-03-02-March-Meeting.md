## Readings
1. [Backward Design][1]

2. [Learner Centered Teaching][2]

3. [Active Learning][3]

## Reading Notes
### [Backward Design][1]
- Flow
    - Identify Desired Results (Big Ideas and Skills)
    - Determine acceptable evidence (Culminating Assessment Task)
    - Plan learning experiences and instruction (Learning events)
- Goals: basic to advanced 
    - **Remember**: the ability to recover and access knowledge from long-term memory
    - **Understand**: the ability to understand, interpret, classify, summarize and compare, and to construct meaning
    - **Apply**: the ability to perform an unfamiliar task by applying previous knowledge to a new situation or problem
    - **Analyze**: ability to organize, differentiate, and attribute
    - **Evaluate**: ability to judge, reason, and  critique
    - **Create**: ability to innovate and produce new knowledge

### [Learner Centered Teaching][2]
- **definition**:  instructional activities involving students in doing things and thinking about what they are doing.
    - simple example: pausing lecture for students to discuss topics with each other
    - complex example: using case studies as a focal point for decision-making
- **Techniques**
    - **The pause procedure**: pause every 12-18 minutes, encourage students to discuss and rework notes in pairs.
    - **Retrieval practice**: Pause for 2/3 minutes every 15 minutes having students write everything they can remember from preceding class segment.
    - **Demonstrations**: ask students to predict the result of a demonstration
    - **Think-pair-share**: ask students a question that requires higher order thinking, think and write an answer for one minute, and then turn to a peer to discuss their responses.

## Meeting Notes
- Gamafied syllabi: built into syllabus that students would take different approaches to the course (scuba diving metaphor deep versus shallow)
- add explicit learning objectives to powerpoint slides
    - also add in questions about the slides
- Useful for setting up conferences and meeting times: scheduler (canvas)
- Be explicit about objectives so when I force them to learn they don't hate it.
- Not being intentional about how we teach, can be harmful to the learners.
